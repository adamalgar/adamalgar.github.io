                <b>What's with all the pipes?</b><br>
                The pipes are used to survey gray treefrogs (<i>Hyla versicolor</i>). During the breeding season, these frogs hang out in vegetation 
                around ponds, where the males make a distinctive trill call to attract females, who choose the best quality 
                males to mate with based on their call. These frogs then move away from ponds into the surrounding trees to feed 
                on insects (mostly ants). During the day, they need to find refuges — somewhere safe and dark to hide. The pipes 
                are perfect refuges, so treefrogs choose to enter the pipes, where we can easily count them to estimate population 
                size, as well as measure and weigh them.

                <b>Please do not disturb!</b><br>
                Please do not disturb the pipes or try to extract treefrogs. This can interfere with our research results, 
                but more importantly it can harm the frogs – they are sensitive to being handled and can be harmed by any 
                chemicals you may have on your hands—such as sunscreen, insect repellent or moisturizer—even in small amounts. 
                There is also a chance that the frogs are carrying <i>Salmonella</i> and thus could make you sick.

                <b>Why gray treefrogs?</b>
                <br>
                Gray treefrogs are found all the way from southern Texas, USA, to Red Lake, northwest of Thunder Bay. 
                This is a huge geographical range and the treefrogs here in Thunder Bay experience very different climate,
                 forest, predators, prey, and competitors than further south. Our research is discovering how this species 
                 has evolved to survive and thrive in such a wide range of environments, especially in the harsh conditions 
                 around Thunder Bay. These discoveries will help us build models that can predict how these species will 
                 respond to future climate change, especially whether they will expand their range northward.

                <b>Does it hurt?</b>
                <br>
                Our research does not harm or injure the frogs — we study frogs because we are fascinated by them, so 
                want to keep them safe and healthy. Frogs can enter and leave the pipes when they want and the ropes in 
                the pipes ensure that if small mammals enter the pipes, they can climb out. We have lots of experience handling frogs 
                in ways to keep them safe before we return them to their pipe. All of our 
                procedures are approved by Lakehead University’s Animal Care Committee and the Ontario Ministry of Northern 
                Development, Mines, Natural Resources, and Forestry.

                <b>Can I help?</b><br>
                I am not currently able to take on volunteers for this summer, but there are other ways to help out. 
                One of the best ways is to get involved in Community Science initiatives. Community Science engages 
                members of the public in collecting data, which can then be used for scientific research. With many 
                people contributing, we can gather far more data than is possible for ‘professional’ scientists to 
                gather on their own. Please consider becoming a community scientist! If you observe treefrogs (or other 
                frogs), you can enter the information on Ontario Nature’s FrogWatch website 
                (<a href="https://www.naturewatch.ca/frogwatch/ontario/" target="_blank">https://www.naturewatch.ca/frogwatch/ontario/</a>). If you are able to get a picture or a sound recording, 
                please upload it to iNaturalist (<a href="https://inaturalist.ca" target="_blank">https://inaturalist.ca</a>). iNaturalist is especially easy – just upload 
                a photo to the app and you can use it for all species, not just frogs. Even if you aren’t able to 
                identify the species you have photographed, the iNaturalist community can help identify it after it 
                is posted. Also check out their iSeek app, which identifies species using your smartphone’s camera.
