                <b>What is this device?</b><br>
                This small device is known as an autonomous recording unit, or ARU. Fancy name for a sound recorder that turns on at
                pre-programmed times each evening. We have dozens of these set up in forested areas across the region as part of our ecological research.
                We are studying gray treefrogs to understand how their geographical range is changing in response to climate change. By setting
                up many ARUS across the frog's range edge, we can monitor year after year whether they are expanding northwards. We are also studying
                how temperature affects calling behaviour, which is why you can see the white/foil plastic box near the ARU. This shields a temperature
                logger from the sun so that we can get accurate air temperaturesato study temperature cues of calling behaviour.

                <b>Please do not disturb!</b><br>
                Please do not disturb the ARUs or the temperature logger. We leave these in place throughout the spring and summer, returning
                regularly to download the data. We will be back to collect them at the end of the summer. If the sun shield or ARU looks damaged, please email me at the address below
                and let me know the ARU number (or the GPS coordinates). Thanks very much!

                <b>Why gray treefrogs?</b>
                <br>
                Gray treefrogs are found all the way from southern Texas, USA, to Red Lake, northwest of Thunder Bay. 
                This is a huge geographical range and the treefrogs here in Thunder Bay experience very different climate,
                 forest, predators, prey, and competitors than further south. Our research is discovering how this species 
                 has evolved to survive and thrive in such a wide range of environments, especially in the harsh conditions 
                 around Thunder Bay. These discoveries will help us build models that can predict how these species will 
                 respond to future climate change, especially whether they will expand their range northward.

                <b>Can I help?</b><br>
                I am not currently able to take on volunteers for this summer, but there are other ways to help out. 
                One of the best ways is to get involved in Community Science initiatives. Community Science engages 
                members of the public in collecting data, which can then be used for scientific research. With many 
                people contributing, we can gather far more data than is possible for ‘professional’ scientists to 
                gather on their own. Please consider becoming a community scientist! If you observe treefrogs (or other 
                frogs), you can enter the information on Ontario Nature’s FrogWatch website 
                (<a href="https://www.naturewatch.ca/frogwatch/ontario/" target="_blank">https://www.naturewatch.ca/frogwatch/ontario/</a>). If you are able to get a picture or a sound recording, 
                please upload it to iNaturalist (<a href="https://inaturalist.ca" target="_blank">https://inaturalist.ca</a>). iNaturalist is especially easy – just upload 
                a photo to the app and you can use it for all species, not just frogs. Even if you aren’t able to 
                identify the species you have photographed, the iNaturalist community can help identify it after it 
                is posted. Also check out their iSeek app, which identifies species using your smartphone’s camera.
