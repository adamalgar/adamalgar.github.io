        Welcome to the online home of the Algar Lab in the Department of Biology at Lakehead University 
        on the shores of Lake Superior amidst Canada's boreal forest. 

        From local interactions to global distributions, we strive to understand how (and if) climate shapes the origins and future of biodiversity.

                <b>Dr. Adam C. Algar (he/him), Associate Professor</b>
                <br>
                I joined the Department of Biology at Lakehead in January 2021, having spent the 10 years prior at the University of Nottingham (UK). As a kid
                growing up on northern Cape Breton Island (Nova Scotia, Canada), chasing birds around the forests and mountaintops, I never imagined
                that my fascination with the natural world could be turned into a career that would lead me to work and live in three countries and do
                fieldwork on three continents. Along the way, I've learned the importance of scientific thinking for understanding the world around us, and the power of big data and statistical models for testing ecologial theory. And even though I work mostly with lizards and frogs,  I still love chasing birds.
                 I am excited to be back in Canada, especially in the remarkable environment around Thunder Bay, which rivals any place in the world I've been for the beauty of its landscape,
                 the wonder of its wildlife, and the potential for new ecological discoveries.
                 <br>
                 <br>
                 If you're interested in working with me, either as an undergrad, or for a Master's, PhD,  Post-Doc, or just a research visit, please contact me as early as possible so we can talk projects and funding. I can be reached at aalgar@lakeheadu.ca.

                <br>
                Cattie has an awesomely apt name and is a youthful 21 years old (we think). Born on the streets, she decided one day in 2005 that her fur-ever home was with Amy and her family. Most hours of most days are spent sleeping, but Cattie also enjoys chasing kibble (kibble can't run very fast, so the chase doesn't sound exciting, but remember that Cattie is 21, so its a more even match than you'd think). Cattie also needs an inhaler which somehow makes her even cuter. Other cute traits include waking her family up at 4am

            <p>On a tiny island in the Caribbean, a small lizard hides from the beating sun underneath a palm frond. 
                On a Scottish moor, a butterfly lazily stretches out its wings in the summer sunshine. And on the 
                shores of Lake Superior, a small frog burrows into the leaf litter as the world freezes around it. No 
                matter where they live, the lives of 'cold-blooded' species are a never-ending thermal balancing act, 
                where tipping too far to the warm or cold can have deadly consequences, but getting it right can have 
                great rewards. 
                <br>
                <br>
                The interaction between an organism's thermal environment and its thermal niche reverberates across all 
                ecological scales: an individual organism may select shaded microhabitats and avoid sunny ones, a 
                population may persist only in cool, closed canopy forest and not at hotter forest edges, or a species' 
                range may not extend beyond the 0°C isotherm. A major goal of our research is to understand how processes 
                involving individuals produce broad-scale, general ecological patterns through space and time. To achieve 
                this we integrate macroecological and macroevolutionary approaches with physiological, functional, and 
                community ecology to determine what sets limits on species' distributions, how these limits have involved and 
                importantly whether we can predict how they will respond to future environmental changes.
            <br>
            <br>
            <b>Study Systems</b>
            <br>
            Our research is question, not system, driven, so we don't work in a single study system, but rather choose a system 
            that allows us to test our hypothesis effectively (and, hopefully, one that we think is pretty cool as well). That 
            said, much of our current work is focused on amphibians, but we have considerable experience with tropical lizards, and have
             worked on systems as varied as invasive crayfish in the UK, endemic plants of the Canary Islands, and even human 
             disease.

            <u>Gray Treefrogs (<i>Hyla versicolor</i>)</u>
            <br>
                Establishing the lab at Lakehead has opened an opportunity to work with species and habitats in Northwestern Ontario. 
                The gray treefrog is one that we are extremely excited about. Why? Well, firstly, this species' range extends all 
                the way from Texas to Northwestern Ontario; any species that inhabits such a range of environments must be harbouring 
                some fascinating eco-evolutionary secrets. Secondly, gray treefrogs have actually been expanding their range 
                northward in the Thunder Bay region over the past decade, which again suggests interesting ecological and evolutionary 
                dynamics playing out in geographical space. Thirdly, the importance of moisture and temperature (hydrothermal niche) 
                for amphibians, alongside their distinct larval (tadpoles) and adult modes of life add exciting dimensions to the 
                study of their range limits. And fourthly, I just really like arboreal ectotherms with toepads. 
            <br>
            <br>
            <u>Lizards</u>
            <br>
                Lizards have long been a workhorse of thermal and evolutionary ecology. Combine this with recent advances in 
                mapping their distributions and resolving their phylogeny  and lizards are an excellent group of animals to 
                try to understand the links between thermal environment, ecological niches and geographic distributions. We 
                have done extensive work on the geographical ecology of <i>Anolis</i> of the Caribbean and Central/South American 
                mainland, but there is still considerable potential for novel insights from old questions and new hypotheses with 
                this system, taking either macroecological or field-based approach (or both). In addition to <i>Anolis</i>, we 
                    have worked with (and would love to again) the endemic <i>Gallotia</i> lizards of the Canary Islands, and 
                    with Agamid lizards in Southeast Asia. 
            <br>
            <br>
            <u>Microclimate for modelling macroecology</u>
            <br>
                One of the challenges of understanding and predicting how species respond to climate change is that organisms 
                do not experience climate, at least not how it is traditionally measured and modelled. Instead, animals experience microclimate, 
                which can very remarkably even over very small spatial and temporal scales. This variation was beautifully 
                captured by Charles Dickens in <i>Great Expectations</i>: "It was one of those March days when the sun 
                shines hot and the wind blows cold: when it is summer in the light, and winter in the shade." Our work 
                in this area has focused on using remote sensing by drones and satellites to improve our ability 
                to model animal operative temperatures at fine resolutions to understand how thermal landscapes contribute to changes in species
                 distributions through space and time.

            <br>
             Underlying the information/facts/knowledge that you have been accumulating thus far in your degree is a long history of research.
            That history will be one of bold conjecture, rigorous data collection, toil, and failure - until, eventually, a tiny kernel of new, knowledge emerges.
            Put that way, research sounds incredibly challenging (and a lot of hard work). It is, but it is also incredibly rewarding, because
            you will learn something that is truly new - something that you, me, or anyone else, didn't know before. And that's pretty amazing.
            <br>
            <br>
            If you're interested in learning more about what research is about, then there are a number of potential ways to engage in research
            in the lab as part of your undergraduate degree. This may involve co-developing your own project with me or assisting
            with ongoing projects. These are important learning experiences in their own right, but are also a great way to test out if you enjoy the research process.
            <br>
            <br>
            Discussing new research ideas is one of the best parts of my job, so I'm happy to meet and discuss potential projects, even if you
            have no idea what you want to work on!

            <br>
            <b>Honour's Thesis (BIOL4101)</b>.
            The Honour's Thesis is a great way to experience the full research cycle - from idea generation, proposing hypotheses, gathering and anaysing data to test predictions,
            working out what the results mean and communicating your findings. To carry out a thesis, you need to find a supervisor - if you're interested in working with me,
            email me (earlier the better) and we can discuss project ideas. There are opportunities to work on field- or big data/modelling-based projects.  
            <br>
            <br>
            <b>Research Internships (BIOL3990/3991)</b>.
            These courses are a great way to get research experience (usually) in your 3rd year, while getting credit toward your degree. They are 'work-terms' and so can be quite varied,
            depending on the work that is going on in the lab during that semester, but you will be working on a project that is part of the lab's larger research program. We will tailor
            this to ensure that you get a chance to develop the skills you are particularly interested in, and are working on topics you find particularly interesting.
            If you're interested in working in my lab for a semester - get in touch and we can discuss options.

        <b>Diversity, Equity & Inclusion</b>
        <br>
        Ecology, as a science, strives to understand the diversity of the natural world. However, it has 
        been far less understanding of, and open to, the diversity of those engaged in ecological research. 
        Like other sciences, ecology has a long history of exclusion, bias, discrimination, racism and colonialism. Many, 
        if not all, of these historical barriers remain. Breaking them down requires continual commitment from all 
        scientists. We have a responsibility to educate ourselves about this inequity, and work toward making ecology a diverse and inclusive discipline, 
        which can 
        only strengthen our science and our society.

                <b>Accessing these papers</b>. The pay-to-publish open access model makes accessing the outcome
                of science more accessible, but it makes makes doing, and communicating, science less open. Instead it concentrates the dissemination of new 
                knowledge within a small group of well-funded researchers 
                who can pay thousands of dollars (or pounds, euros, etc.) to publish a single paper. And while many journals have fee waivers, high fees remain a huge deterrent/barrier. 
                I don't have a solution, but I do think that the gatekeepers of science should be scientific editors and peer-reviewers, not a bank balance.
                The papers below can all be freely accessed, one way or another. For some we've been lucky/privileged
                enough to be able to pay open access fees. <b>For paywalled papers, please email me (aalgar@lakeheadu.ca) and I'll send you a PDF for free</b> - the original open access!

        We respectfully acknowledge that Lakehead University's campuses are located on the traditional lands of Indigenous peoples.
        
        Lakehead Thunder Bay is located on the traditional lands of the Fort William First Nation, signatory to the Robinson Superior Treaty of 1850. Lakehead Orillia is located on the traditional territory of the Anishinaabeg. The Anishinaabeg include the Ojibwe, Odawa, and Pottawatomi nations, collectively known as the Three Fires Confederacy.
        
        Lakehead University acknowledges the history that many nations hold in the areas around our campuses, and is committed to a relationship with First Nations, Métis, and Inuit peoples based on the principles of mutual trust, respect, reciprocity, and collaboration in the spirit of reconciliation
        <br><br>
        Additionally, we respectfully acknowledge that our fieldwork in multiple places around the world has been located on the ancestral and traditional lands of a diverse
        set of Indigenous peoples. This likely includes unceded territory. The very fact that we do not know this for sure demonstrates that we need to continue and improve our commitment to furthering our understanding of the history of the lands on which we
        carry out fieldwork, and improve our understanding and engagement with the traditional and current peoples living and working in these areas.

                <br>
                <i>There is grandeur in this view of life . . . from so simple a beginning endless forms 
                most beautiful and most wonderful have been, and are being, evolved</i> <span style="float:right;">
                    - Charles Darwin</span>
                <br>
                <br>
                This course will introduce you to the fundamentals of evolution across scales of biological organization 
                from genomic change to global biodiversity. To do so, we will travel from a Victorian naturalist's home in 
                England, to the Greater Antilles, glacial lakes in British Columbia, and a very important freezer in a 
                Michigan lab. Along the way, we will meet some of the people who have proposed theory, tested hypotheses, 
                and shaped our evolutionary understanding, from Alfred Russell Wallace to Rosemary Grant. Throughout the 
                class, I hope that not only will you gain an understanding of key evolutionary concepts, but also of why 
                it is one of the most beautiful, elegant, and important ideas in the history of humankind.

                All environments on Earth—from desert to deep ocean, tropical rainforest to urban centre—harbour their own set of 
                species, some unique and some shared, but all striving to survive and reproduce. Community 
                Ecology is the study of these collections of species. It attempts to understand how these species came to occur 
                together in space and time, and if, why, and how they will continue to persist together. It celebrates what makes 
                communities different from each other, but at the same time it searches for common processes and properties that 
                transcend these differences. It is in this search for the general principles generating, regulating, and changing 
                these sets of species that we will discover the science behind the study of ecological communities.
